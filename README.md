# MLOps Pipeline Using Azure Databricks

In this repository I'll show you how to use Azure Databricks for development and training machine learning models including build a MLOps pipeline to serving them with CI/CD process.

The objective is to build an end-to-end project for developing, training, deploying and monitoring machine learning models using Azure Databricks including feature store and MLFlow, at the end we'll have a documentation of all important steps.
